### Weather App 

This project is a weather application that provides real-time weather information for various locations around the world. The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherAPI using an API key and displays it in a user-friendly interface. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating how to integrate external APIs into a web application.

#### Features:

1. **Current Weather Information:**
   - The app displays the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a descriptive weather icon or condition (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).

2. **Search Functionality:**
   - Users can search for weather information by entering the name of a city or location. The app dynamically updates the display with the relevant data from the API.

3. **Weather Icons and Backgrounds:**
   - The app includes visually appealing weather icons and background images that change based on the weather conditions, enhancing the overall user experience.

#### Technologies Used:

- **HTML:** Provides the structure for the application, including the search input, weather display section, and layout elements.
- **CSS:** Handles the styling and layout of the app, ensuring a visually appealing design. 
- **JavaScript:** Implements the core functionality of the app, including fetching data from the OpenWeatherAPI, handling user interactions (such as searching for a city), and updating the DOM with weather information.

#### How It Works:
   - The app uses JavaScript's function to make API calls to the OpenWeatherAPI. An API key is used to authenticate the requests and retrieve data.
   - Upon receiving the weather data, the app processes and extracts relevant information such as temperature, weather conditions, and wind speed.
